# Audio -> Video Generator

This application can be run and used locally by installing the necessary dependencies and running the program without the flask server. It is also deployed as an API on my home server for private use. A web frontend will be coming soon, but contact me if you would like access to the API for your own project.

If running locally you will need an AssemblyAI API key saved as API_KEY="<KEY>" within a config.py file inside of the src/ directory

System dependencies: ImageMagick and ffmpeg

Works on MacOS and Linux, however on native Windows it doesn't work properly so use WSL or a venv.
